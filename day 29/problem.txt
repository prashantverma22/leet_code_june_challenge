Unique paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Constraints:

-> 1 <= m, n <= 100
-> It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.
